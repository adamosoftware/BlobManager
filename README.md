# BlobManager

I started working on this because Red Gate discontinued their excellent free tool Azure Explorer, and Microsoft's own Azure Storage Explorer is way too complicated for the use case I envision. There are other decent blob storage apps out there (CloudBerry comes to mind), but I wanted to take a spin at this. I envisioned a dual-pane interface that put local and remote file lists side-by-side, like Beyond Compare or FileZilla.

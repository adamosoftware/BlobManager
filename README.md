# BlobManager

I started working on this because Red Gate discontinued their excellent free tool Azure Explorer, and Microsoft's own Azure Storage Explorer is way too complicated for the use case I envision. There are other decent blob storage apps out there (CloudBerry comes to mind), but I wanted to take a spin at this. I envisioned a dual-pane interface that put local and remote file lists side-by-side, like Beyond Compare or FileZilla.

As always with something like this, I'm not sure how far I will get. I'm the king of half-done side-projects. I usually stop when it gets hard, and I'm at the point in this now where it's time to do the actual upload.
